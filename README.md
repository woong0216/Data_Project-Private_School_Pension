# Identify the expected status of retirees and propose a model for future pension amounts

## Background
- The pension benefit scheme has been introduced since 1975.
- It was determined that it would be easy to manage the fund if the number of retirees was determined later.

## Propose
- Under the revision of the School Pension Act, the minimum employment standard for retirement benefits has been reduced from 20 years to 10 years, resulting in an unexpected surge in retirement.
- Therefore, it is considered difficult to predict pension expenditure.
- We want to extract Feature Importance, which appears by utilizing data from salary and retirement allowance for each group, and derive regression expressions through correlation that appears.

## Conclusion
- We check the correlation between variables.
- In the future, it is determined that using the model in an institution will increase flexibility in fund management and help it operate stably.
